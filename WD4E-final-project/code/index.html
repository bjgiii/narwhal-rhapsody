      <p>AT0-M1 is a robot gnome who builds smaller robots. He is accompanied by a small sentient anvil, Anvillio. AT0-M1 is somewhat chaotic, but always quick to protect others. His arms change into whatever tool is necessary to finish whatever job comes his way!</p>

        <h3>Doctor Pilot Evelyn Smasher</h3>
        <p>Doctor Pilot Evelyn Smasher is an Astral Elf doctor and pilot from Tarturus IV. She has five PhD's: in
          Medicine, Exobiology, Nuclear Physics, Astronomy, and Alchemy. She is a master of science and magic and is
          extremely intelligent. She is extremely cunning and quick to protect others, but often more concerned with her
          diamonds than anything else.</p>
        <br>
        <section id="three">
          <h3>Spark</h3>
          <p>Spark is what's called a Helper - a group of autognomes created and made to help the multiverse. They are a
            helper at heart - always quick to provide any assistance possible. He carries a beautiful staff with a
            dodecahedral crystal set in its head. Spark is a Cleric: a master of the healing and mystical arts of the
            gods.</p>

            <h3>Duvors D'Fanc&egrave;lands</h3>
            <p>Duvors D'Fanc&egrave;lands is a Bard of Lore from the Fey Wilds. He is a hobgoblin who masquerades as a
              member of the court of Summer, when in actuality he is a spy for the Winter courts! He loves intrigue,
              disuguises, mayhem, and music.</p>

              <h3>Sale</h3>
              <p>Sale is actually the remnant of a long extinct god of commerce. Our crew found his body under the
                control of a giant sentient crystal (Dungeons and Dragons can get crazy!). After destroying the crystal
                we convinced him to come along with us.</p>
