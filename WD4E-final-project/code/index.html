    <p>AT0-M1 is a robot gnome who builds smaller robots. He is accompanied by a small sentient anvil, Anvillio.
      AT0-M1 is somewhat chaotic, but always quick to protect others. His arms change into whatever tool is necessary
      to finish whatever job comes his way!</p>

    <p>Doctor Pilot Evelyn Smasher is an Astral Elf doctor and pilot from Tarturus IV. She has five PhD's: in
      Medicine, Exobiology, Nuclear Physics, Astronomy, and Alchemy. She is a master of science and magic and is
      extremely intelligent. She is extremely cunning and quick to protect others, but often more concerned with her
      diamonds than anything else.</p>
    <br>


    <h3 id="three">Spark</h3>
    <p>Spark is what's called a Helper - a group of autognomes created and made to help the multiverse. They are a
      helper at heart - always quick to provide any assistance possible. He carries a beautiful staff with a
      dodecahedral crystal set in its head. Spark is a Cleric: a master of the healing and mystical arts of the
      gods.</p>

      alt="Duvors D'Fanc&egrave;lands face picture">"
    <p>Duvors D'Fanc&egrave;lands is a Bard of Lore from the Fey Wilds. He is a hobgoblin who masquerades as a
      member of the court of Summer, when in actuality he is a spy for the Winter courts! He loves intrigue,
      disuguises, mayhem, and music.</p>

    <h3 id="five">Sale</h3>
    <img src="HTML-Week3/WD4E-final-project/images/sale.jpg" style="width:50%" alt="Sale face picture">
    <p>Sale is actually the remnant of a long extinct god of commerce. Our crew found his body under the
      control of a giant sentient crystal (Dungeons and Dragons can get crazy!). After destroying the crystal
      we convinced him to come along with us.</p>
